Distributed dynamic process model is a bidirectional coupling eco-hydrological model for (but not limited to) steppe inland river basins in arid and semi-arid regions, which is driven by meteorological data and developed by Dr. Mingyang Li and Prof. Tingxi Liu. And we also call it "MY eco-hydrology model". MY means “my”, which will be released as open source and gradually optimized and updated to get more support from researchers and better improve the model. The MYEH model mainly includes evapotranspiration, runoff, confluence, grazing disturbance, carbon and nitrogen cycle, etc. It absorbs the advantages of various existing ecological models, hydrological models, as well as the framework and algorithm of eco-hydrological models.
